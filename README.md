# Advent of Code 2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety
of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you
like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework,
practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

**_I have chosen to solve every problem this year in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)_**
